What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

This assignment proved more challenging than I thought at first glance. I began early with Lily Garner and Liberty Lehr and we believed that we knew how to set up the assignment. After working on it on Saturday we thought the code was headed in a different direction since we were confused over the directions of the assignment, thinking there was no editing to the code instead just trying to move things around. We found out on Sunday that it was not what we expected so we spent the time we had on Sunday and Monday trying to fix it but ultimately decided to take an extension for a day to finish the homework. We decided to place all of the methods into the oo_resale_shop taking them from procedural_resale_shop and keep the computer simple. 

It's my first time really going through Python in awhile and would probably have been able to solve this earlier last semester. So my advice to someone taking this course in the future is to clarify assignments ASAP in order to not be thrown for a curve when the assignment is almost due.
